            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>deteſted</hi> Conſpiracy entred into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the King of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> which being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered about the end of this year [1605] was in the next year ſuppreſſed by the Death of the Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>To the Petition for Liberty of Conſcience made by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in the former Seſſion of Parliament, and rejected by the King, there was a rumour there would be another preferred at the next Seſſions, (which had been now often deferred) which ſhould be in no danger of being denyed as the former, but ſhould carry with it a neceſſity of being granted by the King whither he would or not. Therefore thoſe that mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Affairs of the Kingdom under a generous and no wayes ſuſpicious King, fearing nothing worſe, did make it their buſineſs to avoid ſuch Petitions, and that neceſſity that did attend them. But among the Conſpirators it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64821:3"/>not, how they might obtain the Kings ſavour, which they now deſpaired of; but how they might revenge that repulſe, though with the ruine of the Kingdom, which the other never thought of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The beginning of theſe Counſels</hi> are to be derived from the latter end of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> For then, as appeared afterwards by proofs and confeſſions, <hi>Robert Winter</hi> (to whom <hi>Oſwald Teſmond</hi> alias <hi>Greenwell,</hi> of the Society of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> joyned himſelf as his Companion) was by the advice of <hi>Hen. Garnet,</hi> Provincial or Superiour of the ſaid Society in <hi>England</hi> (<hi>Robert Cateſby</hi> and <hi>Francis Treſham</hi> of the Gentry, inſtigating) pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately <hi>ſent into</hi> Spain, in the name of the Catholicks, with Letters Commendatory to <hi>Arthur Creſwell</hi> of the ſame Society living in <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dec. <hi>1601.</hi> Mandatis.</note> and with Commands to the King; of which this was the ſumme.</p>
            <p>That he ſhould forthwith ſend an Army into <hi>England,</hi> for which the Catholicks would be ready in Arms as ſoon as it came over. In the mean while that he ſhould aſſign yearly Penſions to ſome Catholick Gentlemen. Furthermore, that he ſhould inſinuate it to the King, that there were ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Military perſons that were aggrieved at the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of things, whom he might eaſily draw to his Part, by relieving their neceſſities. And whereas the greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, after the Landing ſuch an Army, would be for ſupply of Horſes; they in <hi>England</hi> would take care to have Two thouſand Horſes ready provided upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p>This thing was ſecretly tranſacted by the Mediation of <hi>Creſwell</hi> with <hi>Petrus Franceſa</hi> Secretary to King <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Sandovallius</hi> Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and he affirmed that the thing would be very acceptable to King <hi>Philip,</hi> and that he had offered his utmoſt aſſiſtance: that it was alſo agreed among them of the Place of Landing. For if the forces were great, then <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> would be moſt commodious for their Landing; if leſs, <hi>Milford</hi> in <hi>Wales;</hi> and that King <hi>Philip</hi> had promiſed by Count <hi>Miranda</hi> toward that Expedition Ten hundred thouſand Crowns.<note place="margin">Decies centena aureorum <hi>M.</hi>
               </note> Stored with theſe promiſes, <hi>Winter</hi> returns into <hi>England,</hi> and acquaints <hi>Garnet, Catesby,</hi> and <hi>Treſham</hi> what he had done.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64821:3"/>Theſe things were tranſacted under Q <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> who dying about this time, <hi>Chriſtopher Wright</hi> who was privy to theſe Matters, is ſpeedily <hi>ſent into Spain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 1603.</note> who bringing the News of the Queens Death, preſſeth the buſineſs of the Penſions and the Expedition.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Stanly.</note> With him was ſent from <hi>Bruxells</hi> by <hi>William Stanly, Hugh Owen,</hi> and <hi>Balduinus,</hi> (one of the Society of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>) <hi>Guido Fawkes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">22 <hi>Jun.</hi> 1603.</note> with Letters to <hi>Creſwell</hi> that he ſhould ſpeed the buſineſs. To him was given in Command, that he ſhould ſignifie to the King that the Condition of the Catholicks, would be more hard under the new King, then it had been under <hi>Q. Elizabeth;</hi> and therefore that he ſhould by no meant deſiſt from ſo laudable an Enterprize. That <hi>Milford</hi> lay open for an eaſie Landing to <hi>Spinola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the ſlate of things was changed by the death of the Queen, and King <hi>Philip</hi> returned an Anſwer worthy of a King, that he could no longer attend to their Petitions, for that he had ſent Ambaſſadors into <hi>England,</hi> to treat of Peace with the new King.</p>
            <p>Therefore deſpairing of their deſign as to King <hi>Philip,</hi> the Conſpirators fly to their laſt and deſperate Counſels, and in the firſt place they make it <hi>their buſineſs to ſatisfie their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,</hi> and that being done, they confirm their reſolutions to attempt ſome great Enterprize. And <hi>thus their Divines diſcourſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To depoſe Kings, to grant their Kingdome to others, it in the power of the Supream Judge of the Church; But all Hereticks being <hi>ipſo jure</hi> ſeparated from communion of the Faithful, are every year on Holy <hi>Thurſday,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caena Domini.</note> excommunicated by the Pope. And this holdeth not only in Profeſſed Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but in thoſe that are covertly ſuch, becauſe being repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>ipſo Jure</hi> Excommunicate they do incur the (ſame) Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, which are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deſerved by profeſſed Hereticks. From thence it follows, that Kings and other Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces if they fall into Hereſie may be depoſed, and their Subjects diſcharged of their Allegiance. Nor can they recover their Right again, no, not though they ſhould be reconciled to the Church. When it is ſaid that the Church, the Common Mother of all, doth ſhut her boſome againſt none that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64821:4"/>return to her, this is to be underſtood with a diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> provided it be not to the damage or danger of the Church. For this is true as to the Soul, but not as to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Nor ought this puniſhment to be extended only to Princes that are thus infected, but alſo to their Sons, who for their Fathers Sin are excluded from Succeſſion in the Kingdom. For Hereſie is a Leproſie, and an Hereditary Diſeaſe: and to ſpeak more plainly, he loſeth his Kingdom that deſerteth the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion: he is to be accurſed, abdicated, proſcribed; neither is he, nor any of his Poſterity to be reſtored to the Kingdom: as to his Soul, he may be abſolved by the Pope only.</p>
            <p>Thinking themſelves abundantly ſecured <hi>within</hi> by theſe reaſonings, they begin to ſeek <hi>outward</hi> ſtrengthenings to their Conſpiracy: and chiefly <hi>Secreſie,</hi> which they ſealed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the receiving of the Sacrament. To this end there was <hi>an Oath drawn up amongſt them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>May,</hi> 1604.</note> in which they did engage their Faith by the H. Trinity and the Sacrament, which they were preſently to receive, that they would neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly nor indirectly by word or circumſtance diſcover the Plot now to be communicated to them, nor would they deſiſt from proſecuting it, unleſs allowed by their Aſſociates.</p>
            <p>Thus being encouraged by the Authority of their Divines, they betake themſelves to the adventure (as) not only lawful &amp; laudable, but meritorious. This was done before <hi>John Gerard</hi> of that Society.</p>
            <p>Unto this, after Confeſſion, by the Sacrament of the Holy Altar, were drawn in, the next <hi>May,</hi> at firſt five of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, <hi>Robert Catesby, Tho. Winter, Tho. Percy,</hi> Kinſman to the E. of <hi>Northumberland, John Wright,</hi> and the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Fawkes</hi> called out of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catesby, the Author of this Tragedy,</hi> thought it not enough that this, or that, or any ſingle perſon ſhould be aimed at, but that all, together, and at the ſame time, ſhould be comprehended in this Conſpiracy.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64821:4"/>
            <p> For ſo he reaſoned with himſelf.</p>
            <p>The King himſelf might many wayes be taken away, but this would be nothing as long as the Prince and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> were alive: again, if they were removed, yet this would advantage nothing ſo long as there remained a Parliament, ſo vigilant, ſo circumſpect to whatever might happen: or if the Parliament could or the chief Members of it, could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, there would remain ſtill the Peers of the Realm; ſo many Prudent Perſons, ſo many powerful Earls, addicted to that Party, whom they could hardly reſiſt, and who by their Authority, Wealth and Dependants, would be able, if occaſion ſhould be, to reſtore things to their former ſtate. Therefore not by delayes, but at one blow all were to be ſwallowed up, and ſo laudable an Atchievement was to be brought to effect altogether, and at once.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> there is an old Palace of very great Honor and Veneration for its Antiquity, in which the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of the Kingdom are uſed to be celebrated; which by a word borrowed from us, they call a Parliament. In this, the King with His Male iſſue, the Biſhops of His Privy Councel, the Peers, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, the Chief Magiſtrates, and thoſe that are delegated from particular Counties, Cities, Towns, and Burroughs; in ſhort, the Men of greateſt Wiſdom and Counſel do meet together.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Catesby</hi> thought a convenient place to execute his ſo long ſtudied and digeſted Plot: and having made a Vault, and ſtoring it with a great quantity of Gun-Powder, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve all thoſe together, who could not ſeverally be taken, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the King and His Family in the Rubbiſh of the ſame Ruines.</p>
            <p>Therefore when he had dealt with <hi>Piercy,</hi> and he after many bitter complaints of the King, through impatience, broke forth into theſe words, <q>That there was only one way left to be delivered from ſo many Evils, and that was to take the King out of the way, and to that end, as he was ready for any attempt, did freely offer his own Service.</q> 
               <hi>Catesby,</hi> who was more cautious and cunning, moderated the Gentlemans heat, and, <q>God forbid, ſaid he, that this Head of thine ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64821:5"/>dear to all good men ſhould be ſo fruitleſly expoſed to ſuch danger. The buſineſs may be undertaken and accompliſhed, yet ſo as that you and ſuch as you are may ſtill be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for further conſulting for Religion and the Publick weal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then he opens his deſign in very plauſible words, and with like Artifice ſhews him the manner how it was to be effected. <hi>Piercy</hi> agrees, and preſently hires an Houſe nigh to the place, and very opportune to work his Vault.</p>
            <p>The Parliament that was called the year before, was deferred till <hi>February</hi> following.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 1604.</note> Mean while, <hi>Tho. Bates, Catesby</hi>'s Servant, a dextrous Fellow, and one in whom his Maſter did much confide, being, leaſt he ſhould ſuſpect any thing, taken into the privity of the Fact, when at firſt he ſeemed to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the horridneſs of the thing, he is ſent to <hi>Teſmund</hi> alias <hi>Greenwell,</hi> (for thoſe men, that they might the better be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, went under two Names, ſometimes under three) by whom he was perſwaded, and ſtrangely confirmed to the Execution of the deſign, being made ſenſible of the Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of the work. Afterwards <hi>Robert Keyes,</hi> and after him <hi>Ambroſe Rockwood,</hi> and <hi>John Grant,</hi> were taken into the Plot. III Eid. Xbr. <hi>the Vault</hi> was <hi>begun,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dec. <hi>11.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Chriſtopher Witchie,</hi> and a little after <hi>Robert Winter</hi> being alſo taken into the Society.</p>
            <p>The work being often intermitted and often repeated, at length the Vault was brought to the Wall of the Court, where a new difficulty ariſeth from the hardneſs of the Wall, and the thickneſs of three Ells; ſo that under a long time the work could not be finiſhed, and there were now but a few dayes to the ſitting of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>And now the pertinacious induſtry of the Workman had almoſt beat its way through the middle of the Wall, and they ſeemed not ſo much to want good minds (to the work) as time, when as <hi>the Parliament</hi> was <hi>put off till</hi> the Month of <hi>October.</hi> Then <hi>was Deſpair</hi> turned into Joy, with certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that they ſhould effect their deſign: and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that whiles they briskly beat upon the Wall, there was a noiſe heard upon the other ſide of the Wall. Thither <hi>Fawks</hi> is ſent to enquire out the cauſe. He brings word back that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64821:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>there was <hi>a Cellar under Ground,</hi> from whence they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Cole, he beinſt lately Dead who had hired that Cellar for his own uſe. Therefore the Conſpirators thinking that Cellar more commodious, by the help of <hi>Piercy,</hi> let out their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſes, and bring all their <hi>Materials</hi> &amp; hopes into this. Such was the opportuneneſs of the place (for it was almoſt directly under the Royal Throne) that ſo ſeaſonable an accident did make them perſwade themſelves, that God did by a ſecret Conduct favour their Attempt. Theſe things happened about the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> The Gun-powder is at their leiſure carried into the Cellar from <hi>Catesby</hi>'s Houſe over againſt the Palace, where it had been with great care and diligence brought together; Firſt, Twenty Barrels are layed in and covered with Billets and Faggots.</p>
            <p>Then the Conſpirators being ſure of the good event, began to <hi>conſult what was to be done after they had effected their Plot:</hi> Firſt, they conſider'd of taking the Prince, who about that time, they came to underſtand, would not come to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his Father, contrary to what they concluded in the beginning, and againſt him they plotted deſtruction, as one that was no Friend of theirs, and they had found out a way for it.</p>
            <p>The next care was for <hi>Supplies of Money,</hi> concerning which they thought they had ſufficiently provided. They had alſo provided that the <hi>Peers and Gentry addicted to Popery,</hi> ſhould, as much as might be, be <hi>exempt</hi> from danger. Laſtly, they debated concerning <hi>calling in Forreign Princes</hi> to their aſſiſtance; but being doubtful of their faith and ſecreſie, they thought fit not to ſend to them till they had accompliſhed their deſign; for commonly ſuch Actions are not commended but by their Event.</p>
            <p>They paſſed their Judgments upon them ſevceally, <hi>the Spaniards</hi> ſeemed to be more opportune for them, but too remote, and too ſlow in raiſing Forces. <hi>The French</hi> was near, but fearful and ſuſpected for the cloſe league he held with the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The moſt preſent help was from <hi>Flanders,</hi> from whence they might moſt commodiouſly expect Supplies; for which <hi>Stanly</hi> was deſigned the Captain or Commander.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64821:6"/>
            <p> Moreover, that they might the more eaſily deceive the world, and leaſt by their paſſing to and fro to thoſe places they ſhould give ſome cauſe of Suſpition, <hi>they go their ſeveral wayes;</hi> ſome into the Countrey, ſome a great way out of the Iſland, waiting for the time appointed for the Execution. <hi>Fawks</hi> went into <hi>Flanders</hi> that he might acquaint <hi>Stanly</hi> and <hi>Owen</hi> with the whole Matter, nor did he return into <hi>England</hi> till the latter end of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catesby,</hi> that he might not be idle in the mean time, gets <hi>Francis Treſham</hi> and <hi>Everard Digby</hi> to his Party, agreeing with them for <hi>Supply of Money,</hi> and the former promiſd Two thouſand pounds of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, the other Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. <hi>Piercy,</hi> that was prodigal at another mans charge, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed whatſoever he could ſcrape together of the Revenues of the E. of <hi>Northumberland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ten more Barrels of Gun powder</hi> are added to the former, and four more greater than the reſt, upon ſuſpition, leaſt by the moiſtneſs of the place, the former ſhould have been ſpoiled; and again, they are all covered over with a great heap of ſtones and wood</p>
            <p>And now the time of <hi>the Parliaments</hi> convening drew on, which was <hi>again put off</hi> till the <hi>Nones of November.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>5</hi> Nov.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conſpirators did again repeat their conſultation, and ſome were appointed who, on the ſame day that the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was to be Executed, ſhould <hi>ſeize upon the Lady</hi> Elizabeth (the Kings eldeſt Daughter, who was brought up under the Lord <hi>Farrington</hi> in <hi>Warwick-ſhire</hi>) under pretence of an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Match, which <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> who was privy to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, had appointed with great <hi>preparation</hi> at <hi>Dunchuroh.</hi> Her they decreed publickly to Proclaim Queen.</p>
            <p>They taking to themſelves the Titles of the Aſſertors of liberty,<note n="*" place="margin">They purpoſed when the blow was firſt given —but the ſucceſs thereof doubtful, to father the fact on the Puritans. <hi>Fuller</hi> v. <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi> p. <hi>690.</hi>
               </note> did nothing leſs at firſt than profeſs themſelves the Authors of the Fact, or make any mention of Religion to the People, but purpoſed to hold that in ſuſpenſe for ſome time, and by <hi>a Proclamation</hi> publiſhed in the Queens name to redreſs great grievances for the preſent, and feed them with hopes of more for the future, till the Faction growing ſtrong, either by favour or ſeverity of new Edicts, they might draw the People
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64821:6"/>to their Parts and Obedience; and the <hi>odiouſneſs</hi> of their fact ſo by degrees diſcovering it ſelf would in time, and together with their good ſucceſs grow off.</p>
            <p>Nor came it in ſo long time into the minds of any of them how many Innocents all about them, how many Infants, how many that agreed with them in Religion, how many who perhaps had deſerved well of them that vaſt ruine would over-whelm.</p>
            <p>Now all things are ready, and the laſt Scene was going to be Acted, when as by the unſearchable Judgment of God, one who deſired to ſave another, brought deſtruction both to himſelf and his Aſſociates.</p>
            <p>There were ten dayes to the Parliament, when upon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> in the Evening a Letter was brought as from a Friend to the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> but by whom written, is uncertain, and by whom brought unknown. By it he was warned to forbear meeting at the Parliament for the two firſt dayes of the Seſſion; foraſmuch as ſome great, and ſudden, and unſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted miſchief did threaten that Meeting.</p>
            <p>The hand of him that wrote it was unknown, and the writing it ſelf purpoſely ſo ordered, that it could hardly be read. No date to the Letter, no ſubſcription, no inſcription put to it, and the whole compoſure of words ambiguous.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> was doubtful what he ſhould do; therefore late in the night he goeth to <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> and chief Secretary to the King, and giving him the Letter, freely declared to him how he came by it, and how little he valued it. <hi>Cecil</hi> did not make much more account of it, and yet thought it was not altogether to be neglected; and Therefore ſhewed it to the chief Councellors, <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> Chief Admiral of the Seas, the Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to the Earls of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Northampton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The thing being conſidered of amongſt them, although at firſt ſight the Letter ſeemed of no great moment; yet they thought that not the ſlighteſt diſcovery ought to be deſpiſed, eſpecially where the ſafety of the King was endangered, nor ſuch great care to be blamed in them, to whom the preſervation of His Majeſty did both by Office and Duty belong.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64821:7"/>The King was then gone to <hi>Royſton,</hi> to Hunt. It ſeemed good to them to determine nothing before they had conſulted the King. For they ſaid that they had oftentimes experienced the quick apprehenſion, and <hi>happy conjecture</hi> of the King in <hi>unriddleing things that were liable to greateſt doubtfulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Calends of <hi>November,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1</hi> Nov.</note> 
               <hi>the King returned</hi> to the City, and forth with <hi>Cecil</hi> taking him aſide, unfolds the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſhews him <hi>the Letter,</hi> which it ſeems worth while to inſert here for the perpetual remembrance of it; foraſmuch as not without cauſe it afforded ſuch matter of diſpute between him and his Councellors.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The love which I bear to ſome of your Friends makes me careful for your ſafety. Wherefore I adviſe you, as you love your life, that you would invent ſome excuſe for your abſence from the Parliament. For God and Men, as it were by agreement do haſten to puniſh the wickedneſs of this Age. Do not make light of this warning, but depart as ſoon as you can into your own Countrey, where you may ſecurely expect the event. For although no ſigns of troubles do appear, yet I admoniſh you, that that meeting ſhall receive a terrible blow, and ſhall not ſee who ſmiteth them. Do not deſpiſe this diſcovery, it may be profitable to you, it cannot hurt you. For the danger is over as ſoon as you have burnt this Letter. I hope by the grace of God you will make good uſe of this Counſell, to whoſe protection I commend you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King having read the Letter (though through the generouſneſs of his mind, he was no way prone to ſuſpicion) did conjecture that ſome ſtrange thing did lye hid under it, and that the notice given, was by no means to be neglected.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid, it was certainly written by ſome Mad man: For no man well in his wits would ſpeak at this rate of a danger which he doth admoniſh ſo much to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of. <hi>The danger is over as ſoon as you ſhall burn the Letter.</hi> How ſmall a danger could that be which ſhould vaniſh in ſo ſhort a moment.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide the King, in whoſe breaſt the firſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had now taken deep root, urged the foregoing words, <hi>That aſſembly ſhall receive a terrible blow, and ſhall not ſee who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64821:7"/>ſmiteth them.</hi> And whiles walking in the Gallery he deeply thought of theſe things from one particular to another, it came into his mind that a ſudden blow by Gun-powder was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by thoſe words: For what more ſudden then a blow by Gun-powder?</p>
            <p>Thus the King and <hi>Salisbury</hi> ſo broke off their diſcourſe, that the King did ſtrongly perſevere in his conjecture. <hi>Salisbury</hi> to free the Kings mind from fears and cares ſeemed in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to make light of this notice given; but in the mean time admiting within himſelf the Kings uncouth and unuſual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and ſo preſently ſuſpecting it, did conclude, that it was not lightly to be regarded.</p>
            <p>The next day the thing being again conſidered of by the King, and His Counſellors, it ſeemed good that the <hi>Palate</hi> with the places near adjoyning, ſhould be diligently ſearched, and that buſineſs was aſſigned to the Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> who upon the <hi>Monday</hi> which preceded the Parliament, about the Evening, that he might give no occaſion of Rumours, goes with the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> to thoſe places: entring into the houſe that <hi>Percy</hi> had hired, they found a great heap of Billets and Fagots and Coal in a Vault under ground; and <hi>Wineard</hi> the Keeper of the Kings <hi>houſes</hi> being there preſent,<note place="margin">Wardrobe.</note> he was asked for what uſe they were brought in thither? they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the houſe was hired by <hi>Percy,</hi> and that heap was brought in by him.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Chamberlain ſpying <hi>Fawks</hi> ſtanding in a corner of the Cellar, asked who he was, and what buſineſs he had there? Who anſwered, that he was the Domeſtick Servant of <hi>Percy,</hi> and the Keeper of that houſe in <hi>Percy</hi>'s abſence.</p>
            <p>Having thus done, they return to the Court, reporting what they had ſeen, and conjecturing worſe things then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had done. For it came into <hi>Monteagles</hi> mind upon the mention of <hi>Percy,</hi> that he was highly addicted to the Popiſh Religion, that they had formerly been acquainted, and lived as Friends, and it might be that he was the Author of that Letter which gave ground to all this ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chamberlain among other ſuſpicious matters, did revolve in his mind, that that ſtore of wood in the houſe of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64821:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Percy,</hi> where he ſeldom reſided, was not brought in thither to no purpoſe, and that that Servant of <hi>Percy</hi> whom he ſaw in the Cellar, looked like a deſperate, wicked Knave.</p>
            <p>All which things did increaſe the Kings ſuſpition; who would have that Vault further ſearched again; but leaſt if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were found, the Counſellors ſhould make themſelves ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to the People, as if they were afraid of every light report; and moreover, fearing, leaſt whiles they appeared to ſuſpect <hi>Percy,</hi> who was allied in Blood to the chiefeſt Peers of the Realm, they ſhould ſeem to ſuſpect the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> himſelf: yet when the ſafety of the King did prevail upon them, they ſo ordered the matter, that ſearch ſhould be made without noiſe or injury to any.</p>
            <p>It was given in command to Sir <hi>Thomas Knevet,</hi> Juſtice of Peace for <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that in the dead of the Night he ſhould go with a convenient company to that houſe, and ſhould take <hi>Wineard</hi> a long with him, under pretence that he had loſt ſome Hangings and Tapeſtry.</p>
            <p>Thither Sir <hi>Tho. Knevet</hi> going, finds <hi>Fawks, Percy</hi>'s Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Servant, who under a feigned name called himſelf <hi>John Johnſon,</hi> before the Houſe booted and habited for a Journey; and he gives command preſently to lay hold on him. From thence going into the Cellar, he ſpeedily removes the Wood and Coal, which being removed, the Treaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, one little Barrel of Gun-powder being firſt diſcovered by it ſelf, and afterward the heap being removed 36 Barrels of different magnitude were found there.</p>
            <p>Then turning to the Priſoner, and examining his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they found in them tinder, and three Match cords.</p>
            <p>But he being taken in the Fact, and not able to deny, the caſe being now deſperate, he of his own accord confeſſed the Crime, and with an unappalled countenance (as he was a man of a reſolute mind to undertake any deſperate attempt) he added, that it was well for them that they found him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the houſe, now lately come out of the Cellar, in which all things were ready: for if they had found him within, he would not have ſtood to have buried himſelf and them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by putting fire to the Train.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:64821:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Knevet</hi> having diſcovered the matter, returns forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing to the Palace, about Four a Clock in the Morning, and acquaints <hi>Salisbury</hi> and the Lord Chamberlain; who preſently with a noiſe ruſh into the Kings Bed Chamber, and tell him the Treaſon was detected, and they had the Author of it in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody and Bonds.</p>
            <p>The ſame of this being ſpread abroad, for in ſo great a matter of Joy it could not be concealed, <hi>the Conſpirators fly</hi> ſome this way, ſome that way, and <hi>meet together at</hi> Holbech at the houſe of <hi>Stephen Littleton,</hi> in the borders of <hi>Stafford-ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thither came thoſe that were privy to the Conſpiracy out of <hi>Warwick ſhire</hi> and <hi>Worceſter-ſhire;</hi> although they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the diſcovery of the Plot, having taken away by force from Gentlemens houſes their Warr-horſes; thereby giving a manifeſt token what they would have done when they had got the power in their hands, when as they ravaged with ſuch boldneſs, while the event was yet doubtful.</p>
            <p>The Leaders of the Faction truſted that great numbers of Men, and a conſiderable Army would flock into them, as ſoon as they ſhould appear in Arms. But the Lieutenants and Sheriffs being before, while the Treaſon was only ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, Commanded by the King to ride about their Counties, their attempts were all made void, and ſcarcely an Hundred of all that number appeared in Arms. And they were encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by <hi>Richard Walſh,</hi> High Sheriff of the County of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> who came upon them unexpectedly with a ſtrong power of Men, ſo that they could not eſcape.</p>
            <p>When deſpairing of Pardon, and their troubled Conſciences putting them upon deſperate exploits, the <hi>Gun-powder</hi> that was drying by the Fire, took fire by a ſparkle that fell into it, and ſo ſuddenly burnt the Faces, Sides, Arms, Hands of the Beſieged, that they were rendered unable to handle their Arms, and ſo loſt their ſtrength and courage together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Percy,</hi> that were moſt active, together with <hi>Tho. Winter,</hi> while they betake themſelves to a corner of the houſe, are <hi>both ſhot</hi> through with a Leaden Bullet. <hi>Winter</hi> being wounded, fell into the hands of the Kings Party, <hi>both

            </p>
            <p>Being <hi>Examined</hi> without the rack, (for only <hi>Fawks</hi> was put under this way of Examination, and that but moderately) they ſeverally diſcovered the whole ſeries of the matter as we have before recounted, and taxed none in Holy Orders, which many looked upon as purpoſely avoided, becauſe they were bound by Oath not to do it. When as <hi>Franois Treſham</hi> had before he dyed in Priſon of his own accord nominated <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> being admoniſhed thereof by his Wife he wrote a Letter to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and excuſing his too raſh confeſſion, he ſo <hi>diſcharged</hi> Garnet <hi>as much as in him lay</hi> by a ſolemn adjuration interpoſed, that he did entangle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a notorious lye, affirming<note n="†" place="margin">He took it upon his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in <hi>articulo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> (a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing) for within three hours after he dyed. <hi>Proceedings againſt the late Traitors.

            <p>Of whom one was of ſuch a perverſe mind that when <hi>Wikes</hi> did ſhew himſelf to bewail his and his Companions fortune, and for their comfort added, <hi>Though they had loſt their Native Countrey, yet by the Kings grace they had a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring one allowed them.</hi> Nay, ſaith the other, <hi>It is the leaſt part of our grief, that we are baniſhed our Native Countrey, and that we are forced to change our Soil, becauſe every good man counts that his Countrey where he can be well: this doth truly and heartily grieve us, that we could not bring ſo generous and wholſom a deſign to perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which as ſoon as <hi>Vicus</hi> contrary to his expectation, had heard he could hardly for anger abſtain from throwing that man into the Sea, who gloryed in ſuch a Plot as was damned by all men. For ſo I remember I have heard <hi>Vicus</hi> often ſay, when together with <hi>Alexander Delbenius,</hi> he came courteouſly upon the account of our Ancient friendſhip to viſit me, a little before he went from us.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64821:10"/>
            <p> The Plot being diſcovered, the Parliament among publick rejoycings was held with great ſecurity. To whom <hi>the King made</hi> a moſt weighty <hi>Oration,</hi> and ſet forth the inexpreſſible Mercy of God over all his works, towards Himſelf, his Family, and His whole Kingdom, largely aggravating the thing from its ſeveral circumſtances. This <hi>temperament</hi> being<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion with no leſs truth;</hi> That as upon the one part many honeſt men, ſeduced with ſome errors of Popery, may yet remaine good &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects: So as on the other part, none of thoſe that truly know and believe the whole ground, and School concluſions of their Doctrine, can ever prove either good Chriſtians or faithful Subjects. <hi>He had ſaid a little before,</hi> That many honeſt men blinded peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with ſome opinions of Popery, yet do they either not know, or at leaſt not believe all the true grounds of Popery, which is indeed the myſterie of Iniquity.</note> with great Juſtice added, That he <hi>did not ſay, All that were addicted to the Romiſh Religion were to be included as guilty of this Crime: for that there were many among them, who although they are involved in Popiſh Errors (ſo he called them) yet had they not loſt their true Loyalty to Princes, but did obſerve the Duty both of a Chriſtian man, and of a good Subject; and that he in return had good thoughts of them: and that he thought the Severity of the Puritans was worthy of flames, who deny that any Papiſt can be received into Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This likewiſe was worthy the Wiſdom of a moſt juſt Prince, that he did Judge that no <hi>Forreign Prince</hi> nor Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, nor none that did manage affairs for them had any hand in this Conſpiracy, as who did judg of them according to his own mind and temper, and would think of others what he would that they ſhould think of him.</p>
            <p>Therefore he did will and require, that when any mention ſhould be made of this Conſpiracy in Parliament, every one ſhould ſpeak and think honourably of them. Which thing was done for the reſpect that he bore to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom deſiring to keep that peace which he of late made with them, he would not leave any the leaſt appearance of an alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated affection, or a ſuſpicious mind.</p>
            <p>He added this moſt generouſly, That, <hi>he would that all men ſhould underſtand, that reſting in Gods protection, the tranquility and quiet of his mind was not at all diſturbed by this accident, and that he did wiſh that his breaſt were tranſparent to all,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64821:10"/>that his People might behold the moſt ſecret receſſes of his heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when he judged it might conduce much to Example and Publick Security, that he ſhould ſeverely puniſh the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of ſo horrid a Crime, and becauſe there was a ſuſpition ariſing from Letters, Confeſſions and Proofs made, that <hi>Gerard</hi> alias <hi>Braek, Hen. Garnet, Oſwald Teſmond</hi> alias <hi>Greenwell,</hi> were either privy to, or promoters of this Conſpiracy; therefore upon the XVIII. <hi>of the Kalends of</hi> February,<note place="margin">

               <hi>a Proclamation</hi> is <hi>publiſhed againſt them,</hi> and a reward propoſed to him that ſhould diſcover and bring them to their Tryal, as alſo a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty added againſt thoſe who after the publiſhing of this Proclamation ſhould entertain, nouriſh, conceal, or be any way aiding the perſons named in that Proclamation, or ſhould at all indeavour that thoſe who are accuſed of this horrid Crime ſhould not be found out and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
            <p>In order hereunto <hi>diligent ſearch</hi> is made, and ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after them, who concealed themſelves; at length <hi>Hen. Garnet</hi> and —<hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Garnets Servant</hi> were <hi>taken</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Abington</hi> a Papiſt, and ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and caſt into the <hi>Tower.</hi> The wretched Servant for fear leaſt he ſhould be forced by torments to accuſe his Maſter, or deſpairing upon ſome other account, did lay violent hands upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Priſon, and with a blunt knife (for he was not permitted to have a keen one by him) he <hi>cut up his own Belly,</hi> and drew out his Bowels: and although his wound was bound up yet before he could be Examined, he dyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Garnet</hi> was <hi>very gently uſed</hi> in his Impriſonment, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf afterward confeſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At firſt be denyed all things;</hi> and when it did appear that nothing could be drawn from him voluntarily, and the King that he might avoid calumny was unwilling to uſe <hi>torments</hi> upon him, reſolves by craft to illude his <hi>cautious</hi> pertinacy, and to bring him to larger Confeſſions (who would anſwer little or nothing) <hi>whether he would or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſecretly imploys a man, who by deep groans, and frequent complaints againſt the King, and his Counſellors,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64821:11"/>and the deplorable condition of the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> did in the end perſwade <hi>Garnet</hi> that he was Popiſhly enclined, and ſo crept into intimate familiarity with him. This man he ſends with <hi>a Letter to a Gentlewoman,</hi> that was Impriſoned for her Religion, who kept her family at <hi>Whitweb</hi> and other places, and received with great hoſpitality thoſe whom he commended to her. In which Letter he wrote plainly, and yet ſparingly: what things he had already confeſſed, what he was not yet examined upon, and by what means he would excuſe thoſe things (which he had confeſſed) and conceal theſe.</p>
            <p>He wrote likewiſe to <hi>Rookwood</hi> the Prieſt, who was Priſoner in another Priſon, and wrote his <hi>Letter</hi> with Ink in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, about ſome familiar matters that any one might read, but left broad Margents on both ſides, which he filled with his Secrets, <hi>written with the juice of an Orange,</hi> denying all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he had confeſſed before the Lords. As to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Expedition, he ſaid he had obtained the Kings Pardon. As to this laſt Conſpiracy he ſhould avoid Judgment, becauſe he knew they could make no ſufficient proofs againſt him. But however it went, he added, having too high an opinion of himſelf, that which was ſpoken of the only Redeemer of the world, It would be neceſſary that one man ſhould die for the People.</p>
            <p>The Letter was by the Kings Councellors, who ſmelt out the cunning, held to the fire, and preſently the writing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, and the fraud was diſcovered.</p>
            <p>He being every day more and more confident of his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Keeper, told him he did exceedingly deſire to have ſome conference with <hi>Hall,</hi> his Companion. He promiſed to bring it about, and brought both of them to a place where they might eaſily hear one another, and where he himſelf to avoid all ſuſpition might be ſeen by them both. In the mean time, <hi>he placed two men of known credit near the place</hi> who (they knowing no ſuch thing, and minding only the return of their Keeper who was gone abroad) might hear whatſoever paſſed between them. There each of them freely diſcover'd what they had confeſſed, what they had been Examined about, what excuſes and evaſions (for theſe were their words) they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64821:11"/>had prepared for every particular, and many other ſuch things, which being carefully taken, were delivered to the Counſel in writing. The next day (the Priſoners ſuſpecting no ſuch thing) Delegates from the King came to them, and Examine <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Hall</hi> a part, and object to them that they had yeſterday held private conference with one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Garnet</hi> thinking they ſpoke this only upon conjecture<note n="†" place="margin">Upon his Soul, reiterating it with ſo many deteſtable exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, as wounded the Lords hearts to hear him. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, Y 3.</hi>
               </note> ſtifly denyed it, and forſwore it upon the word of a Prieſt.</p>
            <p>At laſt, <hi>Hall</hi> having confeſſed the Fact, and he finding that there was no avoiding it, begged Pardon for his contrary aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration which he ſought to elevate by a <hi>forced</hi> Interpretation or Equivocation! And profeſſing that he would ſpeak the truth ingenuouſly, He anſwered, that <hi>he had hitherto ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly denyed it, becauſe he knew that no man (living) but one,</hi> (<hi>he meant</hi> Greenwell,) <hi>could accuſe him as guilty of the late Fact. But now that he ſaw himſelf encompaſſed with ſuch a cloud of witneſſes, he would no longer diſſemble, but did confeſs that above</hi> V <hi>moneths agone he was acquainted by</hi> Greenwell <hi>with the whole matter. That before that,</hi> Catesby <hi>had in general told him that the Catholicks in</hi> England <hi>were attempting ſome great thing as to Religion, and asked whether if good men ſhould be involved in the danger, this were to be made matter of Conſcience. But that he, who had a contrary command from the Pope, that he ſhould not engage in any Conſpiracy refuſed to hear any further of it. That he did pour out Prayers for the good ſucceſs of the great cauſe, and amongſt other things, uſed the Hymn that was commonly Sung in the Church, but intended nothing elſe when he did ſo, but only prayed God that in the next Parliament no grievous Lawes might be made againſt the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants:</hi> ſo they are called in <hi>England,</hi> who keeping within their own houſes, have their liberty and refuſe to Joyne in <hi>worſhip</hi> with the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Garnet</hi> being <hi>twenty times Examined,</hi>
               <note place="margin">12 <hi>Feb.</hi> and 26 <hi>Mar.</hi>
               </note> between <hi>the Eids of</hi> Febr. <hi>and the</hi> VII <hi>of the Calends of</hi> April, two dayes after he is arraigned at the Publick Tribunal in <hi>London:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here the Crimes are layed to the <hi>charge</hi> of the Priſoner, by Sir <hi>John Crook,</hi> which are afterwards enlarged on in a long Speech by Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> the Kings Attorney General.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64821:12"/>Then after <hi>Garnes</hi> had ſaid ſomething for himſelf, and eſpecially ſomething concerning Equivocation, he was Examined by <hi>Cecil</hi> and others, that ſate as Judges in that caſe. And laſtly, <hi>the Earl of</hi> Northampton made a long and elaborate <hi>diſcourſe</hi> againſt him, in which he largely handled the Authority which the Popes arrogate to themſelves of depoſing Princes, and diſcuſſed that Chapter of <hi>Nos ſanctorum,</hi> the ground, as he ſaid, <hi>of this and ſuch like Conſpiracies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length <hi>Sentence is paſſed</hi> by the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench,</hi> that <hi>Garnet</hi> ſhould be Drawn, Hanged, and Quartered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Plea</hi> for himſelf was only this, that although he did a long time before know of the Conſpiracy, by common ſame and Rumours, (for <hi>Greenwell</hi> only informed him of all the particulars; but under the Seal of Confeſſion, by the Laws of which he was forbidden to diſcover it to any man living): yet that he did admoniſh <hi>Greenwell</hi> to deſiſt from the Fact which he did very much diſapprove of, and to hinder others engaged in Conſcience or privity in it.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Cecill</hi> ſeverely <hi>reproved him;</hi> 
               <q>For, ſaid he, if he did diſapprove of the Fact, why did he afford <hi>Greenwell</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Abſolution before he had by his penitence given teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that he did truly and from his heart deteſt the Fact? Furthermore, when as he underſtood the matter from <hi>Catesby,</hi> where there was no Seal of Confeſſion, this was ſufficient to have made a diſcovery of the Plot if he had ſo highly abhorred it as he did pretend.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But there were other things that lay heavy upon his charge, and theſe chiefly which were amongſt <hi>his Confeſſions,</hi> written with his own hand and ſent to the King, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That <hi>Greenwell</hi> did acquaint him with this not as with a ſin (he had to confeſs) but as an Act which he well enough underſtood, and in which he required his advice and counſel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Greenwell</hi> came to him to require his advice upon the matter, and that the whole buſineſs might be reſolved among them. That <hi>Teſmund</hi> (for ſo he was now called, who e'rewhile was <hi>Greenwell</hi>) and he, did not long agone conſult together in <hi>Eſſex</hi> of the Particulars of this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64821:12"/>Conſpiracy. Laſtly, when <hi>Greenwell</hi> asked who ſhould be Protector of the Kingdom; <hi>Garnet</hi> anſwered, that that anſwer ought to be deferred till they ſaw how things ſhould go.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When theſe things were brought to his remembrance, and did make it appear that he knew of the Conſpiracy otherwiſe then by the way of Confeſſion, all that he anſwered was, that whatſoever he had ſigned with his own hand, was true.</p>
            <p>Being <hi>brought to Execution</hi> the Third of <hi>May</hi> being <hi>Inventio crucis [Holy rood day]</hi> he ſaid, <q>he came thither that day to find an end at length of all the croſſes that he had born in this life; that none were ignorant of the cauſe of his puniſhment; that he had ſinned againſt the King in concealing it; that he was ſorry for it, and humbly begged the Kings Pardon: that the Plot againſt the King and Kingdom was bloody, and which if it had taken effect he ſhould have deteſted with all his heart, and that ſo horrid and inhumane a Fact ſhould be attempted by Catholicks, was that that grieved him more then his death.</q> Then he added many things in defence of <hi>Anne Vaux,</hi> who was held in Priſon, and <hi>lay under great ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon his account.</p>
            <p>Being accuſed that he had while Q <hi>Eliz.</hi> was alive recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved certain <hi>Breves</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> Proceedings, <hi>Q 3.</hi>
               </note> in which he and the Peers inclined to Popery were admoniſhed, <hi>that when that miſerable Woman ſhould happen to die, they ſhould admit of no Prince, how nearly ſoever related in blood, but ſuch as ſhould not only tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Catholick Faith, but by all means promote it;</hi> he ſaid, he had burnt them, the King being received for King. And when the was again Examined upon the ſame things, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>Henry Montacute</hi> who asked him about it,<note place="margin">The Recorder of <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions ſubſcribed by him.</p>
            <p>Being taxed for ſending <hi>Edmund Bainham</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> not to return to the City before the <hi>Plot ſhould take</hi> effect; This he thus excuſed, <q>as if he had not ſent him upon that account; but that he might inform the Pope of the calamitous ſtate of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and conſult with him what courſe the Catholicks ſhould take; and therefore referred them again to his Confeſſions.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64821:13"/>
            <p> Then he kneeled down upon the Stage <hi>to his Prayers,</hi> and looking about hither and thither, did ſeem to be diſtreſſed for the loſs of his life, and to hope a Pardon would be brought him from the moſt merciful Prince: <hi>Montacute</hi> admoniſhed him that he ſhould no longer think of life, but if he knew of <hi>any Treachery</hi> againſt the King or Kingdom, that he ſhould as a dying man preſently diſcover it; for that it was now no time to Equivocate. At which words <hi>Garnet</hi> being ſomewhat moved, made anſwer, <q>that he knew the time did not admit of <hi>Equivocation;</hi> that how far and when it is lawful to Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate he had otherwhere delivered his opinion, that now he did not equivocate, and that he knew nothing but what he had confeſſed.</q> Then he excuſed himſelf that he did <hi>at firſt diſſemble</hi> before the Lords; <q>That he did ſo becauſe he did not think they had had ſuch teſtimony and proof againſt him, till they did produce it; which when they did produce, he thought it as honourable for him to confeſs, as it would have been at firſt to have accuſed himſelf. He added many things to <hi>excuſe Greenwell,</hi> profeſſing that unleſs he thought he were out of danger, he would not have diſcovered the guilt of his dear Brother in this Conſpiracy.</q> Then praying that the<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>In his behalf <hi>Andreas Eudaimon-Johannes</hi> a <hi>Cretian,</hi> of the ſame Society, wrote an<note n="†" place="margin">

               <hi>Apology, in anſwer to Sir</hi> Edw.

Moreover he doth endeavour to evince that <hi>Garnet</hi> never knew any thing of the Conſpiracy but by <hi>the way of</hi> Confeſſion; and that he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abhor the Treaſon.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:64821:13"/>
            <p> Then ſome things are related of <hi>his Conſtancy at his Death,</hi> which are not related in the Hiſtory of it. And as a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Commentary, there is the memorable <hi>Story of the Straw</hi> upon which the Eſſigies of the Dead was ſeen, at which he ſaith his Adverſaries were very much diſturbed.</p>
            <p>Whiles the Body was quartered by the Hangman, ſome drops of blood fell upon the Straw that was there provided to light the fire. <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> who was there preſent, that he might <hi>gather</hi> ſome relique of the Body of <hi>Garnet,</hi> carried home with him an Ear, that was ſprinkled with blood, and depoſited it with a Gentlewoman,<note place="margin">Hu. Griffith<hi>'s Wife.</hi>
               </note> who kept it with great veneration in a Chriſtal-glaſs. Afterward it was obſerved with great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the Effigies of <hi>Garnet</hi> was plainly expreſſed in that blood.</p>
            <p>Then with great Zeal was the ſame of the Miracle ſpread abroad; which others did preſently elude by a contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; ſaying, <q>It ought to ſeem no wonder if a man brought up among Exiles in <hi>Flanders,</hi> improved at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> authorized to a Conſpiracy in his own Countrey, and breathing nothing but revenge, did as long as he lived thirſt after the blood of his Countreymen, ſhould when dead deſerve to be pictured in blood.</q> So dangerous a thing it is in theſe corrupt times to ſay any thing for the honour of any man in thoſe things which do exceed belief and the common courſe of Nature, which may not preſently be retorted to his diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
            <p>This end had <hi>this Conſpiracy;</hi> the ſtrangeſt that either our, or former ages do make mention of, for contrivance, daring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or cruelty. For it is often heard of, and fame doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it down to poſterity, that many Princes are cut off by Treachery, many Common-wealths are attempted by the ſnares and falſhood of their Enemies; But no Countrey, no Age ever bred ſuch a Monſter of Conſpiracy as this, wherein the King with the Queen, the Parents with their whole Iſſue, all the States of the Kingdom, the whole Kingdom it ſelf, and in it innumerable Innocents ſhould all be deſtined to one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in one moment, for a Sacrifice to the luſt of a few enraged Minds.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:64821:14"/>
            <p> But it was very well, that that Monſter, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that bear the blame of it, do both by word and writing every where deteſt, being ſo long before conceived at home, ſhould be ſtrangled in the birth before ever it ſee the light.</p>
            <p>A little while after, <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon</hi> when he went into <hi>England,</hi> thinking of nothing leſs than to be engaged in this buſineſs, upon occaſion of <hi>another Apology</hi> ſent to him, and by him delivered to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> wrote an Elegant <hi>Epiſtle to Fronto Ducaeus,</hi> in which he ſheweth, that <hi>Garnet</hi> knew otherwiſe then under the Seal of Confeſſion of the Powder Conſpiracy, by his own Confeſſion and Teſtimony written with his own hand, and doth at large diſcuſs the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Equivocation,</hi> as enſnaring and pernicious, againſt the Arguments of <hi>Eudaimon-Johannes.</hi> Againſt which, not <hi>Ducaeus,</hi> but <hi>Eudaimon-Johannes</hi> doth rail ſufficiently.</p>
